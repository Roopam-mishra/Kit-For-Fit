# Kit For Fit - Health Tracking Android App
I have created this app as a POC during my internship starting phase. 
It fetches userâ€™s data from google fitness cloud with the help of Fitness APIs (only after user's consent).

This app follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. 
It only takes oAuth Permissions from the user.

This app tracks your today's data and the past week data of the following parameters:
1. Step Counts
2. Calories Expended
3. Distance Travelled 
4. Active Move Minutes
5. Heart Points earned
6. Weight



| Main Screen | Steps Count | Calories Expended |  Distance Covered |

| Move Minutes | Heart Points |  Weight |

Project purpose is to fetch data using Fitness APIs', not UI ðŸ˜„.
